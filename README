What is opm-models?
==============

opm-models [0] is a C++ software framework concerned with fully-implicit
numerical models for flow and transport in porous media. It gets
developed as an integral part of the Open Porous Media (OPM)
initiative [1]. Like all OPM software, opm-models is made available under
the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

opm-models goal is to be an all-encompassing simulation framework for flow
and transport processes in porous media. To achieve this goal, opm-models aims to be as generic as possible, easy to
extend, well performing, and well maintained: It is -- in principle --
capable of simulating all macro-scale scenarios that are relevant for
academic research and industrial applications which involve flow and
transport processes in porous media, while performance-wise,
simulators based on opm-models are often on-par or even faster than the
best commercial solutions.

opm-models uses the same agile development model as all OPM modules; in
particular the main development branch is considered to be unstable
and it thus often incorporates "hard" API changes without a
deprecation period. For this reason, if you are primarily interested
in using opm-models, you are advised to stick to a stable/release version
and to carefully read the change log before upgrading. opm-models releases
are part of OPM releases, i.e., approximately two are prepared each
year.

As a base, opm-models uses the DUNE [2] numerical C++ framework, and it has
been spun off from the source code of the Dumux [3] porous media
simulation suite. Be aware, though, that although Dumux and opm-models have
similar goals and share quite a few concepts, their implementations
have diverged considerably since separation.

INSTALLATION
============

For compiling and installing opm-models, DUNE's 'dunecontrol' utility is
recommended to be used. For details, confer the INSTALL file.

LICENSE
=======

opm-models is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) version two or -- at your option -- any later version. The exact
wording of the GPL can either be read online [4, 5] or it can be found
in the COPYING file.

Please note that opm-models' license -- unlike DUNE's -- does *not* feature
a template exception. In particular, this means that programs which
use opm-models header files must make the program's full source code
available under the GPL to everyone to whom it is distributed to.
